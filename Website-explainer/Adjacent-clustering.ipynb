It is also the field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. \"AI\" may also refer to the machines themselves.\\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and Go).[1]\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[2] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism[3][4] followed by disappointment and loss of funding,[5][6] but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[7] there was a vast increase in funding and interest.\\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field\\'s long-term goals.[8]\\nTo solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields.[9]\\n\\n\\nGoals\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]\\n\\nReasoning, problem-solving\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[10] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[11]\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[12]\\nEven humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[13]\\nAccurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\nKnowledge representation\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[14] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[15] scene interpretation,[16] clinical decision support,[17] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[18] and other areas.[19]\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by domain of knowledge.[20] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as:\\nobjects, properties, categories and relations between objects;\\n[21]\\nsituations, events, states and time;[22]\\ncauses and effects;[23]\\nknowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[24]\\ndefault reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[25] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in KR are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[26] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[13]\\nKnowledge acquisition is the difficult problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c] Modern AI gathers knowledge by \"scraping\" the internet (including Wikipedia). The knowledge itself was collected by the volunteers and professionals who published the information (who may or may not have agreed to provide their work to AI companies).[29] This \"crowd sourced\" technique does not guarantee that the knowledge is correct or reliable. The knowledge of Large Language Models (such as Chat-GPT) is highly unreliable -- it generates misinformation and falsehoods (known as \"hallucinations\"). Providing accurate knowledge for these modern AI applications is an unsolved problem.\\n\\nPlanning and decision making\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][30]\\nIn automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[31] In automated decision making, the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[32]\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[33]\\nIn most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[34]\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[35]\\nInformation value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[36]\\nThe space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the final outcome will be.\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[37]\\nGame theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[38]\\n\\nLearning\\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[39]\\nIt has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[42]\\nSupervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[43]\\nIn reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[44]\\nTransfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[45] Deep learning uses artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.\\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[46]\\n\\n\\nNatural language processing\\nNatural language processing (NLP)[47] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English.\\nSpecific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[48]\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f]\\nunless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[26]).\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (how often one word appears near another),[49] transformers (which finds patterns in text),[50] and others.[51] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[52][53] and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and many other real-world applications.[54]\\n\\nPerception\\nFeature detection (pictured: edge detection) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.\\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[55]\\nThe field includes speech recognition,[56]\\nimage classification,[57]\\nfacial recognition, object recognition,[58]\\nand robotic perception.[59]\\n\\nRobotics\\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (July 2023)\\nRobotics[60] uses AI.\\n\\nSocial intelligence\\nKismet, a robot with rudimentary social skills[61]\\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[62]\\nFor example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[63] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[64]\\n\\nGeneral intelligence\\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[8]\\n\\nTools\\nAI research uses a wide variety of tools to accomplish the goals above.[b]\\n\\nSearch and optimization\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[65] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\nState space search\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[66]\\nFor example, Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[67]\\nSimple exhaustive searches[68]\\nare rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[12]\\n\"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help to prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[69]\\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.[70]\\n\\nLocal search\\nA particle swarm seeking the global minimum\\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a numeric solution to a problem. It begins with some form of a guess and then refines the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. This process is called stochastic gradient descent.[71]\\nEvolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses).[72]\\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[73]\\nNeural networks and statistical classifiers (discussed below), also use a form of local search, where the \"landscape\" to be searched is formed by learning.\\n\\nLogic\\nFormal Logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[74]\\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[75]\\nand predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[76]\\nLogical inference (or deduction) is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are already known to be true (the premises).[77]\\nA logical knowledge base also handles queries and assertions as a special case of inference.[78]\\nAn inference rule describes what is a valid step in a proof. The most general inference rule is  resolution.[79]\\nInference can be reduced to performing a search to find a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.[80]\\nInference performed this way is intractable except for short proofs in restricted domains. No efficient, powerful and general method has been discovered.[81]\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1 and handles uncertainty and probabilistic situations.[82]\\nNon-monotonic logics are designed to handle default reasoning.[25]\\nOther specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains (see knowledge representation above).\\n\\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\nExpectation-maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[83]\\nBayesian networks[84]\\nare a very general tool that can be used for many problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][86]\\nlearning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[h][88]\\nplanning (using decision networks)[89]\\nand perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90]\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[90]\\nPrecise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[91]\\nand information value theory.[92]\\nThese tools include models such as Markov decision processes,\\n[93]\\ndynamic decision networks,[90]\\ngame theory and mechanism design.[94]\\n\\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[95]\\nare functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[43]\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[96] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[97]\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[98] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[99]\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.[100]\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\nA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\\nArtificial neural networks[100] were inspired by the design of the human brain: a simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), casts a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. In practice, the input \"neurons\" are a list of numbers, the \"weights\" are a matrix, the next layer is the dot product (i.e., several weighted sums) scaled by an increasing function, such as the logistic function. \"The resemblance to real neural cells and structures is superficial\", according to Russell and Norvig.  [101][i]\\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[102]\\nNeural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[103]\\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[104]\\nRecurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows  short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.[105]\\nPerceptrons[106]\\nuse only a single layer of neurons, deep learning[107] uses multiple layers.\\nConvolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other – this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.[108]\\n\\n\\nDeep learning\\nRepresenting images on multiple layers of abstraction in deep learning[109]\\nDeep learning[107]\\nuses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[110]\\nDeep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification[111]\\nand others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[112]\\nThe sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[j]\\nbut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[k]\\n\\nSpecialized hardware and software\\nMain articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence\\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow  software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training.[121]\\nHistorically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, and others, had been used.\\n\\nApplications\\nMain article: Applications of artificial intelligence\\nFor this 2018 project of the artist Joseph Ayerle the AI had to learn the typical patterns in the colors and brushstrokes of Renaissance painter Raphael. The portrait shows the face of the actress Ornella Muti, \"painted\" by AI in the style of Raphael.\\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search),\\ntargeting online advertisements,[122]\\nrecommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon),\\ndriving internet traffic,[123][124]\\ntargeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook),\\nvirtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa),[125]\\nautonomous vehicles (including drones,\\nADAS and self-driving cars),\\nautomatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate),\\nfacial recognition (Apple\\'s Face ID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace) and\\nimage labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\\'s iPhoto and TikTok).\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.[126]\\nA few examples are energy storage,[127]\\nmedical diagnosis,\\nmilitary logistics,\\napplications that predict the result of judicial decisions,[128]\\nforeign policy,[129]\\nor supply chain management.\\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI\\'s most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[130] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[131]\\nIn March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.[132] Then it defeated Ke Jie in 2017, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.[133][134][135] Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as for poker at a superhuman level, Pluribus[l] and Cepheus.[137] DeepMind in the 2010s developed a \"generalized artificial intelligence\" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own.[138]\\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. ChatGPT, based on GPT-3, and other large language models, were tried by 14% of Americans adults.[139] The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion[140][141] sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat,[142] the fictional arrest of Donald Trump,[143] and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon,[144] as well as the usage in professional creative arts.[145][146]\\nAlphaFold 2 (2020) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[147]\\n\\nEthics\\nAI, like any powerful technology, has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[148] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[149]\\n\\nRisks and harm\\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\\nMain articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning)\\nMachine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data.[150]\\nThe developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[151]\\nBias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[152][150]\\nFairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias.[153]\\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[154] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[155] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a  \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[156]\\nIf a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[157]\\nThis can occur if machine learning is used inappropriately. Machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. Unfortunately, there are applications that use these predictions as recommendations and some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[158] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.[m]\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[160]\\nMoritz Hardt said “the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn’t work.”[161]\\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist.\\nIn 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different -- the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[162] In 2017, several researchers[n] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[164]\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[155]\\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022) the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings recommending that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[165]\\n\\nLack of transparency\\nSee also: Explainable AI, Algorithmic transparency, and Right to explanation\\nMost modern AI applications can not explain how they have reached a decision.[166] The large amount of relationships between inputs and outputs in deep neural networks and resulting complexity makes it difficult for even an expert to explain how they produced their outputs, making them a black box.[167]\\nThere have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example,  Justin Ko and Roberto Novoa developed a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals, however it classified any image of a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[168] A more dangerous example was discovered by Rich Caruana in 2015: a machine learning system that accurately predicted risk of death classified a patient that was over 65, asthma and difficulty breathing as \"low risk\". Further research showed that in high-risk cases like this, the hospital would allocate more resources and save the patient\\'s life, decreasing the risk measured by the program.[169] Mistakes like these become obvious when we know how the program has reached a decision. Without an explanation, these problems may not not be discovered until after they have caused harm.\\nA second issue is that people who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are required to clearly and completely explain the reasoning behind any decision they make.[170] Early drafts of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[o] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[171]\\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try and solve these problems.[172]\\nThere are several potential solutions to the transparency problem. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[173] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[174] Supersparse linear integer models use learning to identify the most important features, rather than the classification. Simple addition of these features can then make the classification (i.e. learning is used to create a scoring system classifier, which is transparent).[175]\\n\\nBad actors and weaponized AI\\nMain articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[p] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[177] These weapons are considered especially dangerous for several reasons: if they kill an innocent person it is not clear who should be held accountable, it is unlikely they will reliably choose targets, and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[178] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the  United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[179]\\nAI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.[180]\\nTerrorists, criminals and rogue states can use weaponized AI such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons.\\nMachine-learning AI is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[181]\\n\\nTechnological unemployment\\nMain articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments, for example those put forward by Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [182]\\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[183]\\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI.[184] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[185] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[q][187] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment (as opposed to redundancies).[183]\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[188] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[189]\\nIn April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illlustrators had been eliminated by generative artifical intellgence.[190][191]\\n\\nCopyright\\nFurther information: Artificial intelligence and copyright\\nIn order to leverage as large a dataset as is feasible, generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under a rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well, and under what circumstances, this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[192]\\n\\nEthical machines and alignment\\nMain articles: Machine ethics, AI safety, Friendly artificial intelligence, Artificial moral agents, and Human Compatible\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[193]\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[194]\\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[194]\\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[195]\\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"[196]\\nand Stuart J. Russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[197]\\n\\nRegulation\\nMain articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman testifies about AI regulation before a US Senate subcommittee, 2023\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[198]\\nThe regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[199] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[200][201]\\nBetween 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[202]\\nMost EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, US and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[202]\\nThe Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[202] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[203] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[204]\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[200] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[205] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[206][207]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of artificial intelligence\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence.\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[208] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r][210] The first paper later recognized as \"AI\" was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\" in 1943.[211]\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][2] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][3]\\nBy the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[215] and laboratories had been established around the world.[216] Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[217] Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation\\xa0... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[218]\\nThey had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[220] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky\\'s and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[221] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[5]\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[222] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[4] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[6]\\nMany researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.[223] A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[224] Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x]. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[83][229] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[230] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[231]\\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[232]\\nBy 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".[233]\\nSeveral academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[8]\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[7]\\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y]\\nDeep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[235] graphics processing units, cloud computing[236])\\nand access to large amounts of data[237] (including curated datasets,[236] such as ImageNet).\\nDeep learning\\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z]\\nThe amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019,[202]\\nand WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents[238]\\nAccording to \\'AI Impacts\\', about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the US alone and about 20% of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\";[239]\\nabout 800,000 \"AI\"-related US job openings existed in 2022.[240]\\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[241]\\n\\nPhilosophy\\nMain article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\\nDefining artificial intelligence\\nMain articles: Turing test, Intelligent agent, Dartmouth workshop, and Synthetic intelligence\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\"[242]\\nHe advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[242]\\nHe devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[243] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people[aa] but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"[244]\\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\".[245] However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\"[246] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[247]\\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\"[248] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[249] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google[250][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed], a major practitioner in the field of AI.\\nThis definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n\\nEvaluating approaches to AI\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[ab] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\nSymbolic AI and its limits\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[252] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[253]\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[254]\\nPhilosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[255]\\nAlthough his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree.[ac][13]\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[257][258] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\nNeat vs. scruffy\\nMain article: Neats and scruffies\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 70s and 80s,[259]\\nbut eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\nSoft vs. hard computing\\nMain article: Soft computing\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[12] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 80s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\nNarrow vs. general AI\\nMain article: Artificial general intelligence\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals.[260][261]\\nGeneral intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\nMachine consciousness, sentience and mind\\nMain articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[262] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\nConsciousness\\nMain articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[263] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[264]\\n\\nComputationalism and functionalism\\nMain articles: Computational theory of mind, Functionalism (philosophy of mind), and Chinese room\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[265]\\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ad]\\nSearle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.[269]\\n\\nRobot rights\\nMain article: Robot rights\\nIf a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also suffer; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights.[270]\\nAny hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.[271]\\nThis issue has been considered in fiction for centuries,[272]\\nand is now being considered by, for example, California\\'s Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.[273]\\n\\nFuture\\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[261]\\nIf research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[274]\\nHowever, most technologies do not improve exponentially indefinitely, but rather follow an S-curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[275] Consider, for example, transportation: it experienced exponential improvement from 1830 to 1970, but the trend abruptly stopped when it reached physical limits.\\n\\nExistential risk\\nMain article: Existential risk from artificial general intelligence\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as the physicist Stephen Hawking puts it, \"spell the end of the human race\".[276] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[ae] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[278] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\"[279] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[280]\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[281]\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[282] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, Elon Musk have expressed concern about existential risk from AI.[283] \\nIn the early 2010\\'s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research, or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[284] \\nHowever, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[241]\\nIn 2023, AI pioneers including Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\"; some others such as Yann LeCun consider this to be unfounded.[285]\\n\\nTranshumanism\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[286]\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.[287]\\n\\nIn fiction\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction\\nThe word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for \"Rossum\\'s Universal Robots\".\\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[288]\\nand have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[289]\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[290]\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"Multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[291]\\nwhile almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[292]\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[293]\\n\\nSee also\\nAI safety\\xa0– Research area on making AI safe and beneficial\\nAI alignment\\xa0– Conformance to the intended objective\\nArtificial intelligence in healthcare – Machine-learning algorithms and software in the analysis, presentation, and comprehension of complex medical and health care data\\nArtificial intelligence arms race\\xa0– Arms race for the most advanced AI-related technologies\\nArtificial intelligence detection software\\nBehavior selection algorithm\\xa0– Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation\\xa0– Technology-enabled automation of complex business processes\\nCase-based reasoning\\xa0– Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\\nEmergent algorithm\\xa0– Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence\\xa0– List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence\\nOperations research\\xa0– Discipline concerning the application of advanced analytical methods\\nRobotic process automation\\xa0– Form of business process automation technology\\nSynthetic intelligence\\xa0– Alternate term for or form of artificial intelligence\\nUniversal basic income\\xa0– Welfare system of unconditional income\\nWeak artificial intelligence\\xa0– Form of artificial intelligence\\nData sources – The list of data sources for study and research\\nExplanatory notes\\n\\n\\n^ a b This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\\n\\n^ a b This list of tools is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\\n\\n^ It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge.[27][28]\\n\\n^ \\n\"Rational agent\" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence.

I NTRODUCTION\\nIn recent years, the data science (DS) community has\\npursued excellence and made signiﬁcant research efforts to\\ndevelop advanced analytics, focusing on solving technical\\nproblems at the expense of organizational and socio-technical\\nchallenges. Developing and successfully implementing a data\\nscience project to business processes pose signiﬁcant chal-\\nlenges to companies. According to VentureBeat [1], 87%\\nof data science projects never make it into production, and\\na NewVantage survey [2] found that adoption of big data\\nand artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) initiatives remain a signiﬁcant\\nchallenge for 77% of businesses. In fact, 70% of companies\\nreport minimal or no impact from AI [3]. Gartner [4] also\\nreported that 80% of analytics insights will fail to deliver\\nbusiness outcomes by 2022, and 80% of data science projects\\nwill “remain alchemy, run by wizards”. These low success\\nrates in data science projects are indeed noteworthy given the\\ncompetitive advantage that such advanced techniques provide\\nto researchers and practitioners.\\nLeveraging data science within a business organizational\\ncontext involves organizational and socio-technical challenges\\nbeyond the analytical ones: a lack of vision, strategy andclear objectives, a biased emphasis on technical issues, a\\nlack of reproducibility, and role ambiguity are among these\\nchallenges, which lead to a low level of maturity in data\\nscience projects, that are managed in an ad-hoc fashion. The\\nlack of a deﬁned process methodology to manage data science\\nprojects is one of the primary reasons for these challenges. [5].\\nSeveral surveys [6]–[9] have been conducted to collect\\nempirical data on the state of data science project management\\nin both industry and research. According to the ﬁndings of\\nthese surveys, there is a signiﬁcant gap between technical and\\norganizational processes when applied to data science projects.\\nIn this article, we present new empirical data from a\\nsurvey to 237 data science professionals on the use of project\\nmanagement methodologies for data science. Furthermore, we\\nprovide additional proﬁling of the survey respondents’ roles\\n(data scientist, data engineer, business analyst, etc.) and their\\npriorities when executing data science projects.\\nThe rest of the article is structured as follows: Background\\ncontext is presented in Section II, along with organizational\\nand socio-technical challenges that arise when executing a\\ndata science project. Section III describes the methodology\\nfor the survey. Section IV presents and discusses the results\\nobtained from the survey and ﬁnally, Section V describes the\\nmain conclusions of the paper.\\nII. B ACKGROUND CONTEXT\\nData science is a multidisciplinary ﬁeld that lies between\\ncomputer science, mathematics and statistics, and comprises\\nthe use of scientiﬁc methods and techniques, to extract\\nknowledge and value from large amounts of structured and/or\\nunstructured data. After several decades of progress, data\\nscience and machine learning technology are called to become\\na signiﬁcant source of value for a wide range of businesses\\n[10], [11]. However, these recent technological achievements\\ndo not correspond to their application to real-world data\\nscience projects. Data scientists are struggling to deploy their\\nmodels into business processes. Evidence suggests that the\\ngap is widening between organizations successfully gaining\\nvalue from data science and those struggling to do so [12].\\nSigniﬁcant challenges remain unsolved, and many artiﬁcial\\nintelligence initiatives fail.\\n978-1-6654-3902-2/21/$31.00 ©2021 IEEE\\n©2021 IEEE.

The\\nmost popular frameworks in this regard are: CRISP-DM [15],\\nMicrosoft TDSP [16], Agile DS Lifecycle [17], Domino\\nDS Lifecycle [18], IBM FMDS [19], RAMSYS [20], and\\nMIDST [21]. An extensive critical review over 19 data science\\nmethodologies was presented in [14].\\nHowever, while the proposed solutions are leading the\\nway in addressing these organizational and socio-technical\\nchallenges, the reality is that data science projects are not\\ntaking advantage of such methodologies and frameworks.\\nAccording to a survey [22] carried out in 2018 to professionals\\nfrom both industry and non-proﬁt organizations, 82% of the\\nrespondents did not follow an explicit process methodology\\nfor developing data science projects, and equally important,\\n85% of the respondents considered that using an improved\\nand more consistent process would result in more effective\\ndata science projects. Furthermore, a survey conducted to\\nnearly 800 data and analytics leaders by Corinium Intelligence\\n[7] found that only 48% of data science organizations have\\nestablished standardized processes.\\nConsidering a survey from KDnuggets in 2014 [6], the main\\nmethodology used by 43% of respondents was CRISP-DM.\\nThis methodology has been consistently the most commonly\\nused for analytics, data mining, and data science projects, for\\neach KDnuggets poll starting in 2002 up through the most\\nrecent 2014 poll [8]. Recently, Saltz [9] conducted a survey\\nto 109 respondents to gather information about what project\\nmanagement framework teams used to help them execute\\ndata science projects. CRISP-DM is used by nearly half of\\nall respondents. Scrum, Kanban, and customized processes\\nfollowed.\\nAccording to the results of these surveys, the percentage of\\npeople using CRISP-DM has not changed signiﬁcantly over\\nthe last 20 years, indicating that technology has advanced\\nmuch faster than organizational processes for handling data\\nscience projects.III. M ETHODS\\nTo better understand the use of project management method-\\nologies and the priorities of data science professionals during\\nproject execution, a cross-sectional quantitative survey was\\nconducted. This survey focused on understanding the pro-\\nfessional proﬁle of the respondents ( Q1\\x00Q5), the type of\\nprojects they carry out ( Q6\\x00Q8), the most important factors\\nto successfully develop a DS project Q9and whether they use\\nany project methodology Q10\\x00Q11(Table II). In total 237\\nprofessionals from industry and research organizations were\\nsurveyed during September 2021. Participants accessed the\\nsurvey via the LinkedIn professional network.\\nQuestion Fig.\\nQ1 In what country do you work? A.1\\nQ2 Which title best describes your role?

R ESULTS\\nThe results of the survey are presented and discussed in\\nthis section. First, the respondents’ professional proﬁles are\\nexamined. The use of data science methodologies is then\\ninvestigated, and ﬁnally, the relevance scores assigned to\\nﬁfteen success factors are presented.\\nA. Professional proﬁles\\nThe survey included professionals from 35 different coun-\\ntries, the majority of whom work in the United States of\\nAmerica or Spain. Among the survey respondents, 27% were\\ndata scientists, 14% data engineers, 12% business analysts,\\n12% data analysts, 11% machine learning engineers and 6%\\nsoftware developers.

Survey results to additional questions Q3\\x00Q8;Q10. NA means \"Not\\nAnswer\" .\\nThe vast majority of respondents (77%) identiﬁed as male.\\nThe level of job experience among the professionals polled\\nwas distributed as follows: 46% senior, 28% associate, 18%\\nentry-level, and 7% executive. Hence, more than half of the\\nsurveyed professionals have many years of experience under\\nthe belt.\\nWith regard to project characteristics, nearly 40% of the\\nrespondents say a project usually takes more than 6 months\\nto complete, while another 40% says it takes between 3 to\\n6 months. This may suggest that long projects are the norm\\nin the ﬁeld of data science. In terms of projects magnitude,\\n42% of the professionals work on international projects, 35%\\non national and 20% on local projects. This implies that\\nthe majority of data science projects are large and involve\\na large number of stakeholders, who in the case of this\\nsurvey are mostly business organizations (77%). With respect\\nto teamwork, 68% of the professionals polled say they usually\\nwork in groups, with 29% working individually. This shows\\nthe importance of coordination, transparent communication,\\nand collaboration among individuals and teams for the success\\nof DS projects. See Figure 1 for a detailed view on these\\nmatters.\\nB. Data science methodologies\\nWith regard to data science methodologies, Agile DS Lifecy-\\ncleis the most widely used framework, followed by CRISP-\\nDM and Microsoft TDSP (Figure 2). Few people use their\\nin-house methodology.

Other\\nfactors, such as the number of respondents and the distribution\\nof their professional proﬁles, may have skewed these ﬁndings.\\nAn extensive survey could help to reduce this uncertainty.\\nFurthermore, only 25% of the survey participants state\\nthey use some kind of data science project methodology, and\\nanother 29% say it depends on the project. Moreover, the\\nnumber of NA (not answer) responses may suggest that the\\nproportion of people using a DS methodology is less than\\n25%. In any case, this low percentage demonstrates the lack\\nof a deﬁned process methodology for managing data science\\nprojects, which has been recognized as one of the primary\\ncauses for current failures and management challenges.\\nC. Success factors\\nQuestion Q9requested survey participants to evaluate the\\nimportance of ﬁfteen factors for the development and success\\nof data science projects. These factors are thought to contribute\\nto the project’s success in meeting its objectives, and were\\nselected based on an analysis of current challenges in data\\nscience projects [14]. The scoring system followed a 5 point\\nLikert scale, from 1 (not important at all) to 5 (absolutely\\nessential). Figure 3 shows the distribution of the scores, along\\nwith the weighted average and standard deviation for each\\nfactor. The factors are listed in descending order (from top\\nto bottom in the ﬁgure) based on their weighted average\\nscore.

Professionals who follow a project methodology\\ngive more importance to a) the project’s potential risks and\\npitfalls, b) version control, c) the deployment pipeline to\\nproduction, and d) data security and privacy.D. Common factor analysis\\nUsing the results from question Q9, common factor analysis\\nwas conducted to see if there were are any latent variables in\\nthe data, i.e., groups of factors that were answered similarly\\nbased on the survey participants’ scores.\\nTo begin, Bartlett’s test of sphericity and the Kaiser-Meyer-\\nOlkin measure of sampling adequacy were used to check\\nwhether any meaningful latent factors could be found within\\nthe data. The parallel analysis method was then used to\\ndetermine the number of factors, which resulted in 3 factors.\\nThe results of the common factor analysis are shown in\\nFigure 5 (in blue color). Prior to the survey’s public release,\\neach of the ﬁfteen factors was weighted and classiﬁed based\\non three distinct and speciﬁc latent dimensions (in yellow).\\nThese latent variables were selected based on a previous\\npaper by the authors [14], which proposes the principles of\\nan integral methodology for data science that should include\\nthree foundation stones: team, data and project management.\\nMore information on the proposed principles for integral\\nmethodologies can be found in section 5 (discussion) of [14].\\nComparing the results from the common factor analysis with\\nthe authors’ a priori determined weights, it can be observed 4.26 4.25 4.47\\n3.04 3.10 3.233.63 3.52 3.91\\n3.51 3.56 3.653.54 3.52 3.823.79 3.54 3.963.88 4.10 4.02\\n3.51 3.85 3.82\\n3.49 3.75 3.653.88 3.77 4.194.21 4.40 4.46\\n3.96 4.00 4.044.04 3.98 4.12\\n3.69 3.75 3.813.74 3.73 4.21\\n✱✱✱✱\\nData augmentation or metadata enrichmentData visualization toolsHarness knowledge for future workDeﬁne a data lifecycle workﬂowData security and privacyEstablishing timelines and deliverablesUnderstanding each team member skills\\nand roleDeployment pipeline to productionVersion control for code, data & modelsIdentify project potential risks and\\npitfallsProactive team communicationDevelop a strategy to meet project\\nrequirementsTeam collaboration and coordinationCommunicating the results to end-usersPrecisely describe stakeholders needs\\n3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5\\nScoreFactorProfessionals address to DS methodology Yes No Depends on the projectFig. 4.

Hence, based on the relevance\\nscores provided by the survey participants and the conducted\\nfactor analysis, it can be concluded that there are three latent\\nvariables and, in addition, these coincide with the a priori set\\nvalues based on the proposed framework [14].\\nV. C ONCLUSIONS\\nThis article presents new empirical data from a survey to\\n237 data science professionals on the use of project manage-\\nment methodologies for data science. Several aspects of survey\\nrespondents’ work as data science professionals were evalu-\\nated, including their experience level and role (data scientist,\\ndata engineer, business analyst, etc.), projects characteristics\\n(magnitude, duration) and their priorities when executing data\\nscience projects. Regarding the limitations of the presented\\nstudy, note there may be a bias due to the survey’s non-\\nprobabilistic design.\\nAccording to this survey study, the most widely used\\nframework is Agile DS lifecycle , which has surpassed the\\nlong-standing CRISP-DM methodology. However, only 25%\\nof the survey participants state to follow a data science project\\nmethodology. This low percentage shows the lack of a deﬁned\\nprocess methodology for managing data science projects,\\nwhich has been identiﬁed as one of the primary causes for\\ncurrent failures and management challenges.

Furthermore, a\\nstatistical analysis of the scores revealed that professionals\\nwho adhere to a project methodology place a greater emphasis\\non the project’s potential risks and pitfalls, version control,\\nthe deployment pipeline to production, and data security and\\nprivacy. The obtained scores were subjected to a common\\nfactor analysis, which revealed three latent factors. Comparing\\nthe results from the common factor analysis with a priori\\ndetermined weights, the ﬁrst factor was related to the team\\nmanagement facet, the second to the data management aspect\\nand the third to the project management.\\nTherefore, this survey reinforces the notion that the three\\nmost important factors for successful DS projects are project\\ndevelopment, teamwork, and data management. The latter is\\nalso most valued by those professionals who use DS method-\\nologies. However, the methodologies that attempt to address\\nthese three factors and were best valued according to the\\nprinciples of an integral methodology in [14] are hardly known\\nand used. There is still a need for greater dissemination of the\\nmethodologies that reinforce these factors or for improving\\nand incorporating such factors into the most widely used\\nmethodologies.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] VentureBeat, “Why do 87% of data science projects never make it into\\nproduction?” 2019.\\n[2] New Vantage, “NewVantage Partners 2019 Big Data and AI Executive\\nSurvey,” 2019.\\n[3] S.

These low success\\nrates in data science projects are indeed noteworthy given the\\ncompetitive advantage that such advanced techniques provide\\nto researchers and practitioners.\\n Leveraging data science within a business organizational\\ncontext involves organizational and socio-technical challenges\\nbeyond the analytical ones: a lack of vision, strategy andclear objectives, a biased emphasis on technical issues, a\\nlack of reproducibility, and role ambiguity are among these\\nchallenges, which lead to a low level of maturity in data\\nscience projects, that are managed in an ad-hoc fashion. The\\nlack of a deﬁned process methodology to manage data science\\nprojects is one of the primary reasons for these challenges.', metadata={}),\n",

B ACKGROUND CONTEXT\\nData science is a multidisciplinary ﬁeld that lies between\\ncomputer science, mathematics and statistics, and comprises\\nthe use of scientiﬁc methods and techniques, to extract\\nknowledge and value from large amounts of structured and/or\\nunstructured data. After several decades of progress, data\\nscience and machine learning technology are called to become\\na signiﬁcant source of value for a wide range of businesses\\n[10], [11]. However, these recent technological achievements\\ndo not correspond to their application to real-world data\\nscience projects. Data scientists are struggling to deploy their\\nmodels into business processes. Evidence suggests that the\\ngap is widening between organizations successfully gaining\\nvalue from data science and those struggling to do so [12].\\n Signiﬁcant challenges remain unsolved, and many artiﬁcial\\nintelligence initiatives fail.\\n', metadata={})]"
